Thus have I heard.

At one time the Blessed One was staying near Gayā at Gayā Head together
with a thousand bhikkhus. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
thus:

‘Bhikkhus, everything is burning. And what, bhikkhus, is everything
that is burning?

‘The eye, bhikkhus, is burning, forms are burning, eye consciousness is
burning, eye contact is burning, the feeling that arises from eye
contact, whether it is pleasant, painful, or neutral, that too is
burning. With what is it burning? I declare that it is burning with the
fires of passion, hatred, and delusion; it is burning with birth,
ageing, and death, with sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.

‘The ear is burning, sounds are burning, ear consciousness is burning,
ear contact is burning, the feeling that arises from ear contact,
whether it is pleasant, painful, or neutral, that too is burning. With
what is it burning? I declare that it is burning with the fires of
passion, hatred, and delusion; it is burning with birth, ageing, and
death, with sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.

‘The nose is burning, odours are burning, nose consciousness is burning,
nose contact is burning, the feeling that arises from nose contact,
whether it is pleasant, painful, or neutral, that too is burning. With
what is it burning? I declare that it is burning with the fires of
passion, hatred, and delusion; it is burning with birth, ageing, and
death, with sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.

‘The tongue is burning, tastes are burning, tongue consciousness is
burning, tongue contact is burning, the feeling that arises from tongue
contact, whether it is pleasant, painful, or neutral, that too is
burning. With what is it burning? I declare that it is burning with the
fires of passion, hatred, and delusion; it is burning with birth,
ageing, and death, with sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.

‘The body is burning, tangible objects are burning, body consciousness
is burning, body contact is burning, the feeling that arises from body
contact, whether it is pleasant, painful, or neutral, that too is
burning. With what is it burning? I declare that it is burning with the
fires of passion, hatred, and delusion; it is burning with birth,
ageing, and death, with sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.

‘The mind is burning, mental states are burning, mind consciousness is
burning, mind contact is burning, the feeling that arises through mind
contact, whether it is pleasant, painful, or neutral, that too is
burning. With what is it burning? I declare that it is burning with the
fires of passion, hatred, and delusion; it is burning with birth,
ageing, and death, with sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.

‘Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the wise noble disciple becomes disenchanted
with the eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with eye
consciousness, disenchanted with eye contact, and the feeling that
arises from eye contact --- whether it is pleasant, painful, or
neutral --- that too they become disenchanted with.

‘They become disenchanted with the ear, disenchanted with sounds,
disenchanted with ear consciousness, disenchanted with ear contact, and
the feeling that arises from ear contact --- whether it is pleasant,
painful, or neutral --- that too they become disenchanted with.

‘They become disenchanted with the nose, disenchanted with odours,
disenchanted with nose consciousness, disenchanted with nose contact,
and the feeling that arises from nose contact --- whether it is pleasant,
painful, or neutral --- that too they become disenchanted with.

‘They become disenchanted with the tongue, disenchanted with tastes,
disenchanted with tongue consciousness, disenchanted with tongue
contact, and the feeling that arises from tongue contact --- whether it is
pleasant, painful, or neutral --- that too they become disenchanted with.

‘They become disenchanted with the body, disenchanted with tangible
objects, disenchanted with body consciousness, disenchanted with body
contact, and the feeling that arises from body contact --- whether it is
pleasant, painful, or neutral --- that too they become disenchanted with.

‘They become disenchanted with the mind, disenchanted with mental
states, disenchanted with mind consciousness, disenchanted with mind
contact, and the feeling that arises from mind contact --- whether it is
pleasant, painful, or neutral --- that too they become disenchanted with.

‘Becoming disenchanted, their passions fade away; with the fading of
passion the heart is liberated; with liberation there comes the
knowledge: “It is liberated,” and they know: “Destroyed is birth, the
Holy Life has been lived out, done is what had to be done, there is no
more coming into any state of being.”\thinspace ’

Thus spoke the Blessed One; delighted, the bhikkhus rejoiced in what the
Blessed One had said. Moreover, while this discourse was being uttered, the
minds of those thousand bhikkhus were freed from the defilements,
without any further attachment.

Thus ends The Fire Sermon.
