\section{Invitation to Request}

An invitation to request (pavāraṇā), unless
otherwise specified, lasts at most four months.
One may make requests of blood-relatives (but
not in-laws) without receiving an invitation.
One may give special help to one's parents as
well as to one's steward and to anyone prepar[Vin,IV,101–104]
ing to become a bhikkhu.
2. Abusive Speech
The bases of abuse are rank of birth, personal
name, clan name, work, art, disease, physical
appearance, mental stains, faults, and other
bases. There are both direct abuse and sarcasm
and ridicule. Abusive speech may be a base for
either expiation (or wrong-doing) or, when
[Vin,IV,4–11]
only teasing, for dubbhāsita.
3. Unallowable Meats
The flesh of humans (this is a base for thullaccaya), elephants, horses, dogs, snakes, lions,
tigers, leopards, bears, and panthers.
[Vin,I,218–219]

Also unallowable is flesh incompletely cooked,

and meat from an animal seen, heard or suspected to have been killed in order that its meat
be offered to bhikkhus.

\section{Admonishing Another Bhikkhu}

Before admonishing another bhikkhu, a
bhikkhu should investigate five conditions in
himself and establish five other conditions in
himself.
He should investigate thus: ‘Am I one who
practises purity in bodily action?;… purity in
speech?; is the heart of good-will established
in me towards my fellows?; am I one who has
heard the Teachings, practised them, and penetrated them with insight?; is the Discipline
known and thoroughly understood by me?’
And he should establish these five conditions
in himself: he should speak at the right time,
speak of facts, and speak gently, and he
should speak only profitable words, and with
[A,V,78]
a kindly heart.

be confounded?’
