\section*{Admonishing Another Bhikkhu}

Before admonishing another bhikkhu, a bhikkhu should investigate five conditions
in himself and establish five other conditions in himself.

He should investigate thus: ‘Am I one who practises purity in bodily action?;…
purity in speech?; is the heart of good-will established in me towards my
fellows?; am I one who has heard the Teachings, practised them, and penetrated
them with insight?; is the Discipline known and thoroughly understood by me?’

And he should establish these five conditions in himself: he should speak at the
right time, speak of facts, and speak gently, and he should speak only
profitable words, and with a kindly heart.
