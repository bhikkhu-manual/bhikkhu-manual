\section{Āpatti-paṭidesanā (Confession of Offences)}

\subsection{Six reasons for āpatti}

(1) Lack of shame; (2) ignorance of the rule; (3) in doubt
but goes ahead; (4) thinks he ought when he ought not; (5) thinks he ought not
when he ought; (6) acts without thinking (i.e. absent-mindedly).

\subsection{Four conditions for exemption from āpatti}

A bhikkhu who is (1) insane, (2) delirious, (3) suffering intense pain, or (4)
the original perpetrator.

\subsection{The kinds of āpatti}

\textbf{(a)} Those that cannot be remedied (\emph{pārājika}).

\textbf{(b)} Those that can be remedied:

Heavy offences (\emph{saṅghādisesa}), confessed to a Sangha.

Light offences, confessed to another bhikkhu: \emph{thullaccaya} (grave
offences), \emph{pācittiya} (offences of expiation), \emph{pāṭidesanīya}
(offences to be confessed), \emph{dukkaṭa} (offences of wrongdoing), and
\emph{dubbhāsita} (offences of wrong speech).

\subsection{Method of confessing light offences}
\label{confessing-light-offences}

\instr{(Thai Formula)}

Before the general confession any known offences should be specified. Two
bhikkhus with the same offence should not confess that offence together. To do
so is a \emph{dukkaṭa} offence.\suttaRef{Vin.IV.122}

The more junior bhikkhu confesses first, going through the different offence
classes. Then the senior bhikkhu does likewise:

{\centering

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\prul{SAB:} & Senior Acknowledging Bhikkhu\\
\prul{JCB:} & Junior Confessing Bhikkhu\\
\end{tabular}

}

\fi

\hangindent=25pt%
\parbox{22pt}{\prul{JCB:}} Ahaṃ bhante sambahulā nānā-vatthukāyo \emph{thullaccayāyo} āpattiyo āpanno tā paṭidesemi.\\ \emph{I, ven. sir, having many times fallen into grave offences with different bases, these I confess.}

\hangindent=25pt%
\parbox{22pt}{\prul{SAB:}} Passasi āvuso.\\ \emph{Do you see, friend?}

\hangindent=25pt%
\parbox{22pt}{\prul{JCB:}} Āma bhante passāmi.\\ \emph{Yes, ven. sir, I see.}

\hangindent=25pt%
\parbox{22pt}{\prul{SAB:}} Āyatiṃ āvuso saṃvareyyāsi.\\ \emph{In future, friend, you should be restrained.}

\hangindent=25pt%
\parbox{22pt}{\prul{JCB:}} Sādhu suṭṭhu bhante saṃvarissāmi. (×3)\\ \emph{It is well indeed, ven. sir. I shall be restrained.}

% Gavesako: Here add explanation of SCB and JAB

\hangindent=25pt%
\parbox{22pt}{\prul{SCB:}} Ahaṃ āvuso sambahulā nānā-vatthukāyo \emph{thullaccayāyo} āpattiyo āpanno tā paṭidesemi.\\ \emph{I, friend, having many times fallen into grave offences with different bases, these I confess.}

\hangindent=25pt%
\parbox{22pt}{\prul{JAB:}} Passatha bhante.\\ \emph{Do you see, ven. sir?}

\hangindent=25pt%
\parbox{22pt}{\prul{SCB:}} Āma āvuso passāmi.\\ \emph{Yes, friend, I see.}

\hangindent=25pt%
\parbox{22pt}{\prul{JAB:}} Āyatiṃ bhante saṃvareyyātha.\\ \emph{In future, ven. sir, you should be restrained.}

\hangindent=25pt%
\parbox{22pt}{\prul{SCB:}} Sādhu suṭṭhu āvuso saṃvarissāmi. (×3)\\ \emph{It is well indeed, friend. I shall be restrained.}

This formula is repeated replacing ‘\emph{thullaccayāyo}’ with, in turn, ‘\emph{pācittiyāyo}’,
‘\emph{dukkaṭāyo}’, ‘\emph{dubbhāsitāyo}’.

With ‘\emph{dubbhāsitāyo}’ omit ‘\emph{nānā-vatthukāyo}’.

When confessing two offences of the same class:\\
‘sambahulā’ (\emph{many}) → ‘dve’ (\emph{twice})

When confessing a single offence:

‘Sambahulā nānā-vatthukāyo \emph{thullaccayāyo} āpattiyo āpanno tā paṭidesemi.’\\
→ ‘Ekaṃ \emph{thullaccayaṃ} āpattiṃ āpanno taṃ paṭidesemi.’

Replace, as appropriate, ‘\emph{thullaccayaṃ}’ with ‘\emph{pācittiyaṃ}’, ‘\emph{dukkaṭaṃ}’, ‘\emph{dubbhāsitaṃ}’.

\section{Nissaggiya Pācittiya}

When confessing a \emph{nissaggiya pācittiya} (‘expiation with forfeiture’)
offence, substitute ‘\emph{nissaggiyāyo pācittiyāyo}’ for
‘\emph{thullaccayāyo}’, or ‘\emph{nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ}’ for
‘\emph{thullaccayaṃ}’ in the formula at sec.\ref{confessing-light-offences}
above.

However, before confessing, the article in question must be forfeited to another
bhikkhu or to a Sangha. \suttaRef{Vin.III.196f}

\subsection[NP 1 (‘extra robe’)]{Nissaggiya Pācittiya 1 (‘extra robe’)}
\label{np-1-extra-robe}

On the eleventh dawn of keeping one ‘extra robe’, within forearm's length,
forfeiting to a more senior bhikkhu:

‘Idaṃ me \emph{bhante} cīvaraṃ dasāhātikkantaṃ nissaggiyaṃ. Imāhaṃ āyasmato nissajjāmi.’\\
‘\emph{This extra robe, ven. sir, which has passed beyond the ten day (limit), is
  to be forfeited by me: I forfeit it to you.}’

More than one robe, within forearm's length:

‘Imāni me bhante cīvarāni dasāhātikkantāni nissaggiyāni. Imānāhaṃ āyasmato nissajjāmi.’

If forfeiting to a Sangha: ‘āyasamato’ → ‘saṅghassa’ 

If forfeiting to a group of bhikkhus:\\
‘āyasamato’ → ‘āysamantānaṃ’

If senior bhikkhu: ‘bhante’ → ‘āvuso’

If beyond forearm's length:

\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
‘idaṃ’ (\emph{this}) & → & ‘etaṃ’ (\emph{that})\\
‘imāhaṃ’             & → & ‘etāhaṃ’\\
‘imāni’ (\emph{these}) & → & ‘etāni’ (\emph{those})\\
‘imānāhaṃ’             & → & ‘etānāhaṃ’\\
\end{tabular}

\section{Saṅghādisesa}

\textbf{(i)} A bhikkhu who has committed \emph{saṅghādisesa} must first inform
one or more bhikkhus, and then inform a Sangha of at least four bhikkhus of his
fault(s) and ask to observe \emph{mānatta} (penance). When the Sangha has given
\emph{mānatta} to that bhikkhu, he recites the formula undertaking
\emph{mānatta} and then practises the appropriate duties for six days and
nights. When the bhikkhu has completed practising \emph{mānatta}, he requests
rehabilitation (\emph{abbhāna}) in the presence of a Sangha of at least twenty
bhikkhus.

\textbf{(ii)} A bhikkhu who has committed \emph{saṅghādisesa} and deliberately
concealed it must first live in \emph{parivāsa} (probation) for the number of
days that the offence was concealed. When the bhikkhu has completed his time
living in \emph{parivāsa}, he requests \emph{mānatta} and then follows the
procedure outlined in (i) above.
