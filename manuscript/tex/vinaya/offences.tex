\section{Āpatti-paṭidesanā (Confession of Offences)}

\subsection{Six reasons for āpatti}

(1) Lack of shame; (2) ignorance of the rule; (3) in doubt
but goes ahead; (4) thinks he ought when he ought not; (5) thinks he ought not
when he ought; (6) acts without thinking (i.e. absent-mindedly).

\subsection{Four conditions for exemption from āpatti}

A bhikkhu who is (1) insane, (2) delirious, (3) suffering intense pain, or (4)
the original perpetrator.

\subsection{The kinds of āpatti}

\textbf{(a)} Those that cannot be remedied (\emph{pārājika}).

\textbf{(b)} Those that can be remedied:

Heavy offences (\emph{saṅghādisesa}), confessed to a Sangha.

Light offences, confessed to another bhikkhu: \emph{thullaccaya} (grave
offences), \emph{pācittiya} (offences of expiation), \emph{pāṭidesanīya}
(offences to be confessed), \emph{dukkaṭa} (offences of wrongdoing), and
\emph{dubbhāsita} (offences of wrong speech).

\subsection{Method of confessing light offences}

Before the general confession any known offences should be specified. Two
bhikkhus with the same offence should not confess that offence together. To do
so is a \emph{dukkaṭa} offence. \suttaRef{Vin.IV.122}

The more junior bhikkhu confesses first, going through the different offence
classes. Then the senior bhikkhu does likewise:

\subsubsection{Thai Formula}

Junior Confessing Bhikkhu:

‘Āhaṃ bhante sambahulā nānā-vatthukāyo \emph{thullacca yā yo} āpattiyo āpanno tā paṭidesemi.’\\
‘\emph{I, ven. sir, having many times fallen into grave offences with different bases, these I confess.}’

Senior Acknowledging Bhikkhu:

‘Passasi āvuso?’\\
‘\emph{Do you see, friend?}’

JCB:

‘Āma bhante passāmi.’
‘\emph{Yes, ven. sir, I see.}’

SAB:

‘Āyatiṃ āvuso saṃvareyyāsi’\\
‘\emph{In future, friend, you should be restrained.}’

JCB:

‘Sādhu suṭṭhu bhante saṃvarissāmi.’ (×3)\\
‘\emph{It is well indeed, ven. sir. I shall be restrained.}’

Senior Confessing Bhikkhu:

‘Āhaṃ āvuso sambahulā nānā-vatthukāyo \emph{thullacca yā yo} āpattiyo āpanno tā paṭidesemi.’\\
‘\emph{I, friend, having many times fallen into grave offences with different bases, these I confess.}’

Junior Acknowledging Bhikkhu:

‘Passatha bhante?’\\
‘\emph{Do you see, ven. sir?}’

SCB:

‘Āma āvuso passāmi.’\\
‘\emph{Yes, friend, I see.}’

JAB:

‘Āyatiṃ bhante saṃvareyyātha’\\
‘\emph{In future, ven. sir, you should be restrained.}’

SCB:

‘Sādhu suṭṭhu āvuso saṃvarissāmi.’(×3)\\
‘\emph{It is well indeed, friend. I shall be restrained.}’

This formula is repeated replacing ‘\emph{thullaccayāyo}’ with, in turn, ‘\emph{pācittiyāyo}’,
‘\emph{dukkaṭāyo}’, ‘\emph{dubbhāsitāyo}’.

With ‘\emph{dubbhāsitāyo}’ omit ‘\emph{nānā-vatthukāyo}’.

When confessing two offences of the same class:\\
‘sambahulā’ (\emph{many}) → ‘dve’ (\emph{twice})

When confessing a single offence:\\
‘Sambahulā nānā-vatthukāyo \emph{thullacca yā yo} āpattiyo āpanno tā paṭidesemi.’\\
→ ‘Ekaṃ \emph{thullacca yaṃ} āpattiṃ āpanno taṃ paṭidesemi.’

Replace, as appropriate, ‘\emph{thullaccayaṃ}’ with ‘\emph{pācittiyaṃ}’, ‘\emph{dukkaṭaṃ}’, ‘\emph{dubbhāsitaṃ}’.

\subsubsection{Sri Lankan Formula}

Junior Confessing Bhikkhu:

‘Okāsa, ahaṃ bhante, sabbā āpattiyo ārocemi.\\
Dutiyam-pi ahaṃ bhante, sabbā āpattiyo ārocemi.\\
Tatiyam-pi ahaṃ bhante, sabbā āpattiyo ārocemi.’\\
‘\emph{I ven. sir, declare all offences. For the second time… For the third time…}’

Senior Acknowledging Bhikkhu:

‘Sādhu, sādhu.’\\
‘\emph{It is good, it is good.}’

JCB:

‘Okāsa ahaṃ bhante, sambahulā nānā-vatthukā āpattiyo āpajjiṃ, tā tumha-mūle paṭidesemi.’\\
‘\emph{I, ven. sir, having many times fallen into many different offences with different bases, these I confess.}’

SAB:

‘Passasi āvuso tā āpattiyo?’\\
‘\emph{Do you see, friend, those offences?}’

JCB:

‘Āma bhante passāmi.’\\
‘\emph{Yes, ven. sir, I see.}’

SAB:

‘Āyatiṃ āvuso saṃvareyyāsi.’\\
‘\emph{In the future, friend, you should be restrained.}’

JCB:

‘Sādhu suṭṭhu bhante āyatiṃ saṃvarissāmi.\\
Dutiyam-pi sādhu suṭṭhu bhante āyatiṃ saṃvarissāmi.\\
Tatiyam-pi sādhu suṭṭhu bhante āyatiṃ saṃvarissāmi.’\\
‘\emph{It is well indeed, ven. sir, in future I shall be restrained. For the second time…For the third time…}’

SAB:

‘Sādhu, sādhu.’\\
‘\emph{It is good, it is good.}’

JCB:

‘Okāsa ahaṃ bhante,\\
sabbā tā garukāpattiyo āvikaromi.\\
Dutiyam-pi okāsa ahaṃ bhante,\\
sabbā tā garukāpattiyo āvikaromi.\\
Tatiyam-pi okāsa ahaṃ bhante,\\
sabbā tā garukāpattiyo āvikaromi.’

‘\emph{Ven. sir, I reveal all heavy offences. For the second time… For the third time…}’

This final declaration is only used in some communities. Also, some communities
will acknowledge with a ‘\emph{Sādhu}’ after each declaration rather than as
shown above. That is, after each ‘\emph{ārocemi}’ and each
‘\emph{saṃvarissāmi}’.

\subsubsection{Sri Lankan Formula for same base offences}

JCB:

‘Okāsa ahaṃ bhante, desanādukkaṭāpattiṃ āpajjiṃ, taṃ tumha-mūle paṭidesemi.’\\
‘\emph{I, ven. sir, confess an offence of wrong-doing through having confessed the same-based offences.}’

SAB:

‘Passasi āvuso taṃ āpaṭṭiṃ?’\\
‘\emph{Do you see, friend, that offence?}’

JCB:

‘Āma bhante passāmi.’\\
‘\emph{Yes, ven. sir, I see.}’

SAB:

‘Āyatiṃ āvuso saṃvareyyāsi.’\\
‘\emph{In the future, friend, you should be restrained.}’

JCB:

‘Sādhu suṭṭhu bhante āyatiṃ saṃvarissāmi.\\
Dutiyam-pi sādhu suṭṭhu … .\\
Tatiyam-pi … saṃvarissāmi.’\\
‘\emph{It is well indeed, ven. sir, in future I shall be restrained. For the second time… For the third time…}’

SAB:

‘Sādhu, sādhu.’\\
‘\emph{It is good, it is good.}’

\section{Nissaggiya Pācittiya}

When confessing a nissaggiya pācittiya (‘expiation with forfeiture’) offence, substitute ‘nissaggiyāyo pācittiyāyo’ for ‘thullaccayāyo’, or
‘nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ’ for ‘thullaccayaṃ’ in
the formula <5.iv> above.
♦However, before confessing, the article in
question must be forfeited to another bhikkhu
or to a Sangha.
[Vin,III,196f]

(i) Nissaggiya Pācittiya 1 (‘extra robe’)
On the eleventh dawn of keeping one ‘extrarobe’, within forearm's length, forfeiting to a
more senior bhikkhu:
‘Idaṃ me *bhante* cīvaraṃ dasāhātikkantaṃ
nissaggiyaṃ, imāhaṃ āyasmato nissajjāmi.’
(‘This extra robe, ven. sir, which has passed beyond the
ten day (limit) is to be forfeited by me: I forfeit it to you.’)

• More than one robe, within forearm's
length:
‘Imāni me bhante, cīvarāni dasāhātikkantāni
nissaggiyāni, imānāhaṃ āyasmato nissajjāmi.’
• If forfeiting to a Sangha:
‘āyasamato’ →‘saṅghassa’ [Vin,III,197]
• If forfeiting to a group of bhikkhus:
‘āyasamato’ →‘āysamantānaṃ’
• If senior bhikkhu: ‘bhante’ →‘āvuso’
• If beyond forearm's length:
‘idaṃ’ (this) →‘etaṃ’(that)
‘imāhaṃ’ →‘etāhaṃ’
‘imāni’(these) →‘etāni’ (those)
‘imānāhaṃ’ →‘etānāhaṃ’

(ii) Returning the robe
‘Imaṃ cīvaraṃ āyasmato dammi.’
(‘I give this robe to you.’)

[Vin,III,197]

• For returning more than one robe:
‘imaṃ’ →‘imāni’ ; ‘cīvaraṃ’ →‘cīvarāni’
♦This formula for returning the article(s) also

applies in Nis. Pāc. 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 below.

(iii) Nissaggiya Pācittiya 2 (‘separated from’)
‘Idaṃ me bhante cīvaraṃ ratti-vippavutthaṃ
aññatra bhikkhu-sammatiyā nissaggiyaṃ.
Imāhaṃ āyasmato nissajjāmi.’
(‘This robe, ven. sir, which has stayed separate (from
me) for a night without the consent of the bhikkhus,

is to be forfeited by me: I forfeit it to you.’)
[Vin,III,199–200]

• If multiple robes: ‘cīvaraṃ’ → ‘dvicīvaraṃ’/

‘ticīvaraṃ’ (two- / three-robes)

passed beyond the month limit, is to be forfeited
by me: I forfeit it to you.’)
[Vin,III,205]

‘Imāni me bhante akāla-cīvarāni
māsātikkantāni nissaggiyāni.
Imānāhaṃ āyasmato nissajjāmi.’

♦ For returning the robe(s) see <6.ii> above.

(v) Nissaggiya Pācittiya 6 (‘asked for’)

gahapatikaṃ aññatra samayā viññāpitaṃ
nissaggiyaṃ, imāhaṃ āyasmato nissajjāmi.’
(‘This robe, ven. sir, which has been asked from an
unrelated householder at other than the proper
occasion, is to be forfeited by me: I forfeit it to you.’)
[Vin,III,213]

• For more than one piece of cloth:

gahapatikaṃ aññatra samayā viññāpitāni
nissaggiyāni. Imānāhaṃ āyasmato nissajjāmi.’

\section{Saṅghādisesa}

(i) A bhikkhu who has committed saṅghādisesa must first inform one or more bhikkhus,
a n d t he n i n f or m a S a n g h a of a t l e a s t f ou r
bhikkhus of his fault(s) and ask to observe
mānatta. When the Sangha has given mānatta
to that bhikkhu, he recites the formula undertaking mānatta and then practises the
appropriate duties for six days and nights.
When the bhikkhu has completed practising
mānatta, he requests rehabilitation (abbhāna)
in the presence of a Sangha of at least twenty
bhikkhus.
(ii) A bhikkhu who has committed saṅghādisesa and deliberately concealed it must first
live in parivāsa (probation) for the number of
days that the offence was concealed. When
the bhikkhu has completed his time living in
parivāsa, he requests mānatta and then follows the procedure outlined in (i) above.
