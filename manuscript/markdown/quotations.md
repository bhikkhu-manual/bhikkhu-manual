## Admonishing Another Bhikkhu<a id="admonishing-another-bhikkhu"></a>

Before admonishing another bhikkhu, a bhikkhu should investigate five
conditions in himself and establish five other conditions in himself.

He should investigate thus: 'Am I one who practises purity in bodily
action?;... purity in speech?; is the heart of good-will established in
me towards my fellows?; am I one who has heard the Teachings, practised
them, and penetrated them with insight?; is the Discipline known and
thoroughly understood by me?'

And he should establish these five conditions in himself: he should
speak at the right time, speak of facts, and speak gently, and he should
speak only profitable words, and with a kindly heart.

*A.V.78*

Trade in weapons, in human beings, in animal flesh, in liquor, in
poison.

*A.III.207*

## Dealing with Doubtful Matters (Kālāma-sutta)<a id="dealing-with-doubtful-matters"></a>

Be not led by report, by tradition, by hearsay, by the authority of
texts, by mere logic, by inference, by considering appearances, by its
agreement with an established theory, by seeming possibilities, by the
idea 'This is our teacher'.

*A.I.189*

## The Gradual Teaching<a id="the-gradual-teaching"></a>

Talk on: generosity and giving; morality; the ease and happiness of
heavenly realms; the disadvantages of sensual pleasures; the benefits of
renouncing sensual pleasures.

*D.I.148*

## The Three Cravings and the Four Attachments<a id="the-three-cravings-and-the-four-attachments"></a>

attachment to the idea of self.

*D.III.230; M.I.66*

## The Three Universal Characteristics of Existence<a id="the-three-universal-characteristics-of-existence"></a>

## The Three Kinds of Suffering<a id="the-three-kinds-of-suffering"></a>

The suffering of pain (*dukkha-dukkhatā*). The suffering of conditioned

(*vipariṇāma-dukkhatā*).

*D.III.216; S.IV.259*

consciousness food.

*D.III.228; M.I.48; S.II.101*

## The Four Bases of Judgement<a id="the-four-bases-of-judgement"></a>

and righteous behaviour.

*A.II.71*

## The Five Facts to be Frequently Contemplated<a id="the-five-facts-to-be-frequently-contemplated"></a>

I am subject to decay and I cannot escape it. I am subject to disease
and I cannot escape it. I am subject to death and I cannot escape it.
There will be division and separation from all that I love and hold
dear. I am the owner of my actions -- whatever I do, whether good or
bad, I must be heir to it.
