## Invitation to Request<a id="invitation"></a>

An invitation to request (*pavāraṇā*), unless otherwise specified, lasts at most
four months. One may make requests of blood-relatives (but not in-laws) without
receiving an invitation. One may give special help to one's parents as well as
to one's steward and to anyone preparing to become a bhikkhu.

*Vin.IV.101–104*

## Hatthapāsa Distance<a id="hatthapasa-distance"></a>

The *hatthapāsa* generally means a distance within arm's reach, or
forearm's length. There are variations in the specific way of measuring
it.

It may be measured from the trunk of the body, until the tip of the
fingers of one's extended hands, about 1.25 metres. That is, one bhikkhu
should be able to reach the other.

Other interpretations consider that the distance between the bodies of
two bhikkhus should not be greater than the length from the elbow to the
tip of the fingers. For example, a forearm's distance between the knees
of two seated bhikkhus.

The distance is measured horizontally, the vertical elevation is not
taken into account.

## Days and Dawns<a id="days-and-dawns"></a>

The Vinaya definition for *one day* is the period of time between two
dawnrises.

If one extends a hand and is able to see the lines in the palm (assuming
the sky is clear), the dawnrise *has already passed*.

One may also use a clock and the time of *nautical twilight*. While the
Sun is between 12 and 6 degrees below the horizon, dawnrise *has not yet
passed*. Once the Sun is less than 6 degrees below the horizon, dawnrise
*has passed*.

## Seven-day Allowable Period<a id="seven-day-allowable-period"></a>

The *seven-day tonics* are permitted to be kept until the seventh
*dawnrise*, not for a seven-day period, which is already past the
seventh dawnrise.

The factor of *effort* here is keeping the tonic past the seventh
dawnrise after receiving it.

*Perception* is not a factor, if one thinks the seventh dawnrise hasn't
passed, but it has, it is nonetheless a *nissaggiya pācittiya* offence.

The offence is to be confessed by the bhikkhu who received the items. If
he has travelled away since, and the items are no longer with him to be
forfeited, he may confess the offence, and the other bhikkhus may
forfeit the items.

## Mixing Allowables<a id="mixing-allowables"></a>

The day on which food, one-day, seven-day and lifetime allowables are
received should be kept in mind when mixing them, or consuming a
mixture. Such a mistake can be made for example when receiving biscuits
at the meal time, and mixing it with tea or coffee made with allowables
offered on a previous day.

The mixture takes on the shortest lifetime of the ingredients. The
combinations are described in the *Mahāvagga*:

(a.) 1d juice, received that morning\
<span class="vin"></span>\+ food, received that morning\
<span class="vin"></span>&rarr; is allowable that morning

(b.) 7d tonic, received that morning\
<span class="vin"></span>\+ food, received that morning\
<span class="vin"></span>&rarr; is allowable that morning

(c.) lifetime medicine, received that morning\
<span class="vin"></span>\+ food, received that morning\
<span class="vin"></span>&rarr; is allowable that morning

(d.) 7d tonic, received sometime\
<span class="vin"></span>\+ juice, received that day\
<span class="vin"></span>&rarr; is allowable until dawn

(e.) lifetime medicine, received sometime\
<span class="vin"></span>\+ juice, received that day\
<span class="vin"></span>&rarr; is allowable until dawn

(f.) lifetime medicine, received sometime\
<span class="vin"></span>\+ 7d tonic, received sometime\
<span class="vin"></span>&rarr; is allowable for 7 days

Consuming the mixture outside its allowable period is a *pācittiya* offence
under *Pc 38 (Stored food)*, even through lack of mindfulness. Perception is not
a factor.

*Mv. VI.40.3.*

## The Eight Utensils (aṭṭha-parikkhārā)<a id="the-eight-utensils"></a>

The three robes, the bowl, a razor/sharp knife, needle, belt, water-filter.

*Ja.I.65*

## Unallowable Meats<a id="unallowable-meats"></a>

The flesh of humans (this is a base for *thullaccaya*), elephants, horses, dogs,
snakes, lions, tigers, leopards, bears, and panthers.

*Vin.I.218-219*

Also unallowable is flesh incompletely cooked, and meat from an animal seen,
heard or suspected to have been killed in order that its meat be offered to
bhikkhus.

*Vin.I.218-219*

## Abusive Speech<a id="abusive-speech"></a>

The bases of abuse are rank of birth, personal name, clan name, work, art,
disease, physical appearance, mental stains, faults, and other bases. There are
both direct abuse and sarcasm and ridicule. Abusive speech may be a base for
either expiation (or wrong-doing) or, when only teasing, for *dubbhāsita*.

*Vin.IV.4-11*

## Lighting a Fire<a id="lighting-a-fire"></a>

Suitable reasons for lighting a fire, or having one lit (Pc. 56) include the
health benefit of warmth, or needing the fire for a task, such as boiling water
or burning garden waste.

For the health benefit, one is considered *ill (gilāno)* when one can not get by
comfortably without warming oneself.

For a task, lighting a fire may damage plants (Pc. 11) and living creatures (Pc.
61), either on the ground or in the fire wood. Damage to plants or living
creatures on the ground may be avoided by lighting the fire on stones, sand, in
a tin box, or using portable gas stoves.

One may also indicate the task (*kappiya-vohāra*) for lay friends without an
explicit instruction, who may light the fire.
