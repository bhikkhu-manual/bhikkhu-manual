## Āpatti-paṭidesanā (Confession of Offences)<a id="āpatti-patidesana"></a>

### Six reasons for āpatti<a id="six-reasons"></a>

(1) Lack of shame; (2) ignorance of the rule; (3) in doubt
but goes ahead; (4) thinks he ought when he ought not; (5) thinks he ought not
when he ought; (6) acts without thinking (i.e. absent-mindedly).

### Four conditions for exemption from āpatti<a id="four-conditions"></a>

A bhikkhu who is (1) insane, (2) delirious, (3) suffering intense pain, or (4)
the original perpetrator.

### The kinds of āpatti<a id="kinds"></a>

**(a)** Those that cannot be remedied (*pārājika*).

**(b)** Those that can be remedied:

Heavy offences (*saṅghādisesa*), confessed to a Sangha.

Light offences, confessed to another bhikkhu: *thullaccaya* (grave
offences), *pācittiya* (offences of expiation), *pāṭidesanīya* (offences
to be confessed), *dukkaṭa* (offences of wrongdoing), and *dubbhāsita*
(offences of wrong speech).

### Method of confessing light offences<a id="confessing-light-offences"></a>

<div class="instr">

> (Thai Formula)

</div>

Before the general confession any known offences should be specified. Two
bhikkhus with the same offence should not confess that offence together. To do
so is a *dukkaṭa* offence.

*Vin.IV.122*

**SB:** Senior Bhikkhu\
**JB:** Junior Bhikkhu

<div class="instr">

> Junior bhikkhu is confessing:

</div>

**JB:** Ahaṃ bhante sambahulā nānā-vatthukāyo *thullaccayāyo* āpattiyo āpanno tā paṭidesemi.

*I, ven. sir, having many times fallen into grave offences with different bases, these I confess.*

**SB:** Passasi āvuso.

*Do you see, friend?*

**JB:** Āma bhante passāmi.

*Yes, ven. sir, I see.*

**SB:** Āyatiṃ āvuso saṃvareyyāsi.

*In future, friend, you should be restrained.*

**JB:** Sādhu suṭṭhu bhante saṃvarissāmi. (×3)

*It is well indeed, ven. sir. I shall be restrained.*

**SB:** Ahaṃ āvuso sambahulā nānā-vatthukāyo *thullaccayāyo* āpattiyo āpanno tā paṭidesemi.

*I, friend, having many times fallen into grave offences with different bases, these I confess.*

**JB:** Passatha bhante.

*Do you see, ven. sir?*

**SB:** Āma āvuso passāmi.

*Yes, friend, I see.*

**JB:** Āyatiṃ bhante saṃvareyyātha.

*In future, ven. sir, you should be restrained.*

**SB:** Sādhu suṭṭhu āvuso saṃvarissāmi. (×3)

*It is well indeed, friend. I shall be restrained.*

This formula is repeated replacing '*thullaccayāyo*' with, in turn, '*pācittiyāyo*', '*dukkaṭāyo*', '*dubbhāsitāyo*'.

With '*dubbhāsitāyo*' omit '*nānā-vatthukāyo*'.

When confessing two offences of the same class:\
'sambahulā' (*many*) → 'dve' (*twice*)

When confessing a single offence:

'Sambahulā nānā-vatthukāyo *thullaccayāyo* āpattiyo āpanno tā paṭidesemi.'\
→ 'Ekaṃ *thullaccayaṃ* āpattiṃ āpanno taṃ paṭidesemi.'

Replace, as appropriate, '*thullaccayaṃ*' with '*pācittiyaṃ*', '*dukkaṭaṃ*', '*dubbhāsitaṃ*'.

## Nissaggiya Pācittiya<a id="nissaggiya-pacittiya"></a>

When confessing a *nissaggiya pācittiya* ('expiation with forfeiture') offence,
substitute '*nissaggiyāyo pācittiyāyo*' for '*thullaccayāyo*', or '*nissaggiyaṃ
pācittiyaṃ*' for '*thullaccayaṃ*' in the formula at [Light Offences](#confessing-light-offences) above.

However, before confessing, the article in question must be forfeited to another
bhikkhu or to a Sangha.

*Vin.III.196f*

### Nissaggiya Pācittiya 1 (‘extra robe’)<a id="np-1-extra-robe"></a>

On the eleventh dawn of keeping one ‘extra robe’, within forearm's length,
forfeiting to a more senior bhikkhu:

'Idaṃ me *bhante* cīvaraṃ dasāhātikkantaṃ nissaggiyaṃ. Imāhaṃ āyasmato nissajjāmi.'

'*This extra robe, ven. sir, which has passed beyond the ten day (limit), is to
be forfeited by me: I forfeit it to you.*'

More than one robe, within forearm's length:

‘Imāni me bhante cīvarāni dasāhātikkantāni nissaggiyāni. Imānāhaṃ āyasmato nissajjāmi.’

If forfeiting to a Sangha: ‘āyasamato’ → ‘saṅghassa’ 

If forfeiting to a group of bhikkhus:\
‘āyasamato’ → ‘āysamantānaṃ’

If senior bhikkhu: ‘bhante’ → ‘āvuso’

If beyond forearm's length:

'idaṃ' (*this*) → 'etaṃ' (*that*)\
'imāhaṃ' → 'etāhaṃ'\
'imāni' (*these*) → 'etāni' (*those*)\
'imānāhaṃ' → 'etānāhaṃ'

#### Returning the robe<a id="np-1-returning-the-robe"></a>

'Imaṃ cīvaraṃ āyasmato dammi.'\
'*I give this robe to you.*' *Vin.III.197*

For returning more than one robe:\
'imaṃ' → 'imāni' ; 'cīvaraṃ' → 'cīvarāni'

This formula for returning the article(s) also applies in NP. 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10 below.

### Nissaggiya Pācittiya 2 (‘separated from’)<a id="np-2"></a>

'*This robe, ven. sir, which has stayed separate (from me) for a night without
the consent of the bhikkhus, is to be forfeited by me: I forfeit it to you.*'

## Saṅghādisesa<a id="sanghadisesa"></a>

**(i)** A bhikkhu who has committed *saṅghādisesa* must first inform one or more
bhikkhus, and then inform a Sangha of at least four bhikkhus of his fault(s) and
ask to observe *mānatta* (penance). When the Sangha has given *mānatta* to that
bhikkhu, he recites the formula undertaking *mānatta* and then practises the
appropriate duties for six days and nights. When the bhikkhu has completed
practising *mānatta*, he requests rehabilitation (*abbhāna*) in the presence of
a Sangha of at least twenty bhikkhus.

**(ii)** A bhikkhu who has committed *saṅghādisesa* and deliberately concealed
it must first live in *parivāsa* (probation) for the number of days that the
offence was concealed. When the bhikkhu has completed his time living in
*parivāsa*, he requests *mānatta* and then follows the procedure outlined in (i)
above.
