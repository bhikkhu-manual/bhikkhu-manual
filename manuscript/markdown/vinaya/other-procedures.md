## Nissaya (Dependence)<a id="nissaya"></a>

Taking dependence happens either individually or with the whole community before
the Rains Retreat and Winter Retreat. It is frequently preceded by *Asking for
Forgiveness*, see [Asking for Forgiveness](#asking-forgiveness) for preparation.

The bhikkhu:

> ‘Ācariyo me bhante hohi,\
> āyasmato nissāya vacchāmi.’ (×3)

*(Ven. sir, may you be my teacher. I shall stay dependent on the ven. one.)*

The Ācariya:

> ‘Sādhu, lahu, opāyikaṃ, paṭirūpaṃ,\
> pāsādikena sampādehi.’

*(It is good; ...convenient; ...suitable; ...proper; ... you should endeavour to conduct yourself in a good manner.)*

*Vin.I.60–61*

The bhikkhu:

> ‘Sādhu bhante. Ajja-t-agge-dāni thero mayhaṃ bhāro, aham-pi therassa bhāro.’ (×3)

*(It is good, ven. sir. From this day onwards the Elder will be my burden and I shall be the burden of the Elder.)*

*Sp.V.977*

At the end, bow three times and sit with feet folded on one side. The senior
monk may offer advice and encouragement in the practice.

## Kappiya-karaṇa (Making Fruit Allowable)<a id="kappiya"></a>

For fruit with seeds or vegetables that can grow again, the bhikkhu says:

'Kappiyaṃ karohi' '*Make it allowable.*'

The lay person, while 'marking' (cutting, tearing or burning) the fruit,
etc., responds:

'Kappiyaṃ bhante.' '*It is allowable, ven. sir.*'

*Sp.IV.767--768*

## Entering Town after Midday<a id="midday"></a>

Leave can be taken in one's own language, or in Pali:

'Vikāle gāmappavesanaṃ āpucchāmi.'\
*(I take leave to go to the town at the 'wrong time'.)*

*Kv.140*

## Saṅghadāna-apalokana (Sharing Saṅghadāna)<a id="sanghadana"></a>

After *saṅghadāna* is offered, a bhikkhu, other than the senior *Thera*,
recites:

> 'Yagghe bhante saṅgho jānātu.\
> Ayaṃ paṭhama-bhāgo *therassa* pāpuṇāti.\
> Avasesā bhāgā amhākañc'eva pāpuṇanti.\
> Bhikkhūnañca sīladharānaṃ sāmaṇerānaṃ gahaṭṭhānaṃ\
> Te yathāsukhaṃ paribhuñjantu.' (×3)

'therassa' → 'mahātherassa'

<div class="english">

> 'May the Saṅgha hear me. The first portion (of this offering) goes to
> the Elder. The remainder is for the rest of us here: for the bhikkhus,
> sīladharās, sāmaṇeras and lay people. May they partake of it as they
> please.'

</div>

The Sangha responds: 'Sādhu.'

*Sp.VII.1405--1409*

## Paṃsukūla-cīvara (Taking Rag-cloth)<a id="rag-cloth"></a>

'Imaṃ paṃsukūla-cīvaraṃ assāmikaṃ mayhaṃ pāpuṇāti.'\
'*This rag-cloth, which is ownerless, has reached me.*'

## Desanā<a id="desana"></a>

### Requesting permission to speak on Vinaya<a id="speak-on-vinaya"></a>

<div class="instr">

> After bowing three times, with hands joined in añjali, addressing the senior elder:

</div>

‘Okāsaṃ me bhante thero detu vinaya-kathaṃ kathetuṃ.’

‘Namo… (×3); Buddhaṃ Dhammaṃ Saṅghaṃ namassāmi.’

‘Vinayo sāsanassa āyū'ti. Karotu me āyasmā okāsaṃ ahan-taṃ vattukāmo.’

‘*Ven. sir, please give permission to speak on Vinaya... Vinaya is the life of
the religion. I ask for permission from the ven. one: I wish to speak about the
Vinaya.*’

Reply: ‘Karomi āyasmato okāsaṃ.’

‘*I give you the opportunity, venerable.*’

*Vin.I.113*

### Requesting permission to speak on Dhamma<a id="speak-on-dhamma"></a>

<div class="instr">

> After bowing three times, with hands joined in añjali, addressing the senior bhikkhu:

</div>

‘Okāsaṃ me bhante thero detu dhamma-kathaṃ kathetuṃ.’

‘*Ven. sir, please give permission to speak on Dhamma.*’

‘Namo... (×3); Buddhaṃ Dhammaṃ Saṅghaṃ namassāmi.’

<div class="instr">

> One may recite a sutta quote before beginning the talk, such as:

</div>

‘Apārutā tesaṃ amatassa dvārā ye sotavantā pamuñcantu saddhaṃ.’

‘*Open are the doors to the Deathless. May all those who have ears release their faith.*’

‘Ito paraṃ sakkaccaṃ dhammo sotabbo'ti.’

‘*After this you should attentively listen to the Dhamma.*’

## Añjali<a id="anjali"></a>

Chanting and making formal requests is done with the hands in añjali.
This is a gesture of respect, made by placing the palms together
directly in front of the chest, with the fingers aligned and pointing
upwards.

## Requesting a Dhamma Talk<a id="requesting-dhamma-talk"></a>

<div class="instr">

> After bowing three times, with hands joined in añjali, recite the following:

</div>

Brahmā ca lokādhipatī sahampati\
Katañjalī anadhivaraṃ ayācatha

Santīdha sattāpparajakkha-jātikā\
Desetu dhammaṃ anukampimaṃ pajaṃ

<div class="instr">

> (Bow three times again)

</div>

<div class="english">

> The Brahmā god Sahampati, Lord of the world,\
> With palms joined in reverence, requested a favour:
> 
> `Beings are here with but little dust in their eyes,\
> Pray, teach the Dhamma out of compassion for them.'

</div>

*Buddhavaṃsa 1*

## Acknowledging the Teaching<a id="acknowledging"></a>

After the talk, the person next in seniority after the speaker, chants:

'Handa mayaṃ dhamma-kathāya / ovāda-kathāya sādhukāraṃ dadāmase.'

*Now let us express our approval of this Dhamma teaching / exhortation.*

If an exhortation, use *ovāda-kathāya* instead of *dhamma-kathāya*.

The listeners, together:

'Sādhu, sādhu, sādhu. Anumodāmi.'\
*It is well, I appreciate it.*

### After the talk on Vinaya or Dhamma<a id="vinaya-or-dhamma"></a>

When the talk is concluded, the speaker chants:

'Ayaṃ dhamma- / vinaya- / dhammavinaya-kathā sādh'āyasmantehi saṃrakkhetabbā'ti.'

'*This talk on Dhamma / Vinaya / Dhammavinaya should be well-preserved by you, ven. sirs.*'

The person next in seniority after the speaker:

'Handa mayaṃ dhamma- / vinaya- / dhammavinaya-kathāya sādhukāraṃ dadāmase.'

'*Now let us make the act of acknowledging this Dhamma / Vinaya / Dhammavinaya talk.*'

The listeners, together:

'Sādhu, sādhu, sādhu. Anumodāmi.'

## Requesting the Three Refuges &amp; the Five Precepts (Thai Tradition)<a id="three-refuges"></a>

<div class="instr">

### Taking Leave after Uposatha<a id="taking-leave"></a>

Having undertaken the Eight Precepts, lay followers may stay overnight at the monastery. The next
morning they will take their leave from the senior monk:

<div class="instr">

> Laypeople:

</div>

Handa dāni mayaṃ bhante āpucchāma\

<div class="instr">

> Senior monk:

</div>

‘Yassa dāni tumhe kālaṃ maññatha.’

‘*Please do what is appropriate at this time.*’

## Disrobing<a id="disrobing"></a>

After the bhikkhus who are to witness the disrobing have assembled, the bhikkhu
who will disrobe should first confess his offences and ask for forgiveness.
Wearing all his three robes, with his *saṅghāti* on his left shoulder:

Bow three times.

‘Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammā-sambuddhassa’ (×3)

Optionally, one may chant [Recollection After Using the Requisites](../chants/reflections.html#recollection-after).

Bow three times.

Recite in Pali and in his own language:

‘Sikkhaṃ paccakkhāmi. Gihī'ti maṃ dhāretha.’

*I give up the training. May you regard me as a layman.*

He may state this once, three times, or as many times as he needs to assure
himself that he is now a layman and no longer a bhikkhu. If two or more are
disrobing, they should state this passage separately.

The former bhikkhu then withdraws to change into lay clothes. When he returns,
he may request the [Three Refuges and Five Precepts](#three-refuges).
