## Dedication of Offerings (English)<a id="dedication"></a>

To the Blessed One, the Lord, who fully attained perfect enlightenment,\
To the Teaching which he expounded so well,\
And to the Blessed One's disciples who have practised well,\
To these &ndash; the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha &ndash;\
We render with offerings our rightful homage.\
It is well for us that the Blessed One, having attained liberation,\
Still had compassion for later generations.\
May these simple offerings be accepted\
For our long-lasting benefit and for the happiness it gives us.

The Lord, the Perfectly Enlightened and Blessed One &ndash;\
I render homage to the Buddha, the Blessed One.

The Teaching so completely explained by him &ndash;\
I bow to the Dhamma.

The Blessed One's disciples who have practised well &ndash;\

## Salutation to the Triple Gem (English)<a id="salutation-english"></a>

> [Now let us chant our salutation to the Triple Gem and a passage to arouse urgency.]

The Buddha, absolutely pure, with ocean-like compassion,\
Possessing the clear sight of wisdom,\
Destroyer of worldly self-corruption &ndash;\
Devotedly indeed, that Buddha I revere.\
The Teaching of the Lord, like a lamp,\
Illuminating the Path and its Fruit: the Deathless,\
That which is beyond the conditioned world &ndash;\
Devotedly indeed, that Dhamma I revere.\
The Saṅgha, the most fertile ground for cultivation,\
Those who have realized peace, awakened after the Accomplished One,\
Noble and wise, all longing abandoned &ndash;\
Devotedly indeed, that Saṅgha I revere.

This salutation should be made to that which is worthy.\
Through the power of such good action, may all obstacles disappear.\
One who knows things as they are has come into this world; and he is an Arahant, a perfectly Awakened being,\
Purifying the way leading out of delusion, calming and directing to perfect peace, and leading to enlightenment &ndash; this Way he has made known.

Having heard the Teaching, we know this:\
Birth is dukkha,\
Ageing is dukkha,\
And death is dukkha;\
Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are dukkha;\
Association with the disliked is dukkha;\
Separation from the liked is dukkha;\
Not attaining one's wishes is dukkha.\
In brief, the five focuses of identity are dukkha.

These are as follows:\
Attachment to form,\
Attachment to feeling,\
Attachment to perception,\
Attachment to mental formations,\
Attachment to sense-consciousness.\
For the complete understanding of this,\
The Blessed One in his lifetime frequently instructed his disciples in just this way.

In addition, he further instructed:\
Form is impermanent,\
Feeling is impermanent,\
Perception is impermanent,\
Mental formations are impermanent,\
Sense-consciousness is impermanent;

Form is not-self,\
Feeling is not-self,\
Perception is not-self,\
Mental formations are not-self,\
Sense-consciousness is not-self;\
All conditions are transient,\
There is no self in the created or the uncreated.\
All of us are bound by birth, ageing, and death,\
By sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair,\
Bound by dukkha and obstructed by dukkha.\
Let us all aspire to complete freedom from suffering.

<div class="instr">

> The following is chanted only by the monks and nuns.

</div>

Remembering the Blessed One, the Noble Lord, and Perfectly Enlightened One, who long ago attained Parinibbāna,\
We have gone forth with faith from home to homelessness,\
And like the Blessed One, we practise the Holy Life,\
Being fully equipped with the bhikkhus'/nuns' system of training.\
May this Holy Life lead us to the end of this whole mass of suffering.\

<div class="instr">

> An alternative version of the preceding section, which can be chanted by laypeople as well.

</div>

The Blessed One, who long ago attained Parinibbāna, is our refuge.\
So too are the Dhamma and the Saṅgha.\
Attentively we follow the pathway of that Blessed One, with all of our mindfulness and strength.\
May then the cultivation of this practice\
Lead us to the end of every kind of suffering.
