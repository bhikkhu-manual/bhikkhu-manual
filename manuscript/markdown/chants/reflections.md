In freedom from anxiety, and may they\
Maintain well-being in themselves.

May all beings be released from all suffering.

And may they not be parted from the good fortune\
they have attained.

When they act upon intention,\
All beings are the owners of their action\
and inherit its results.\
Their future is born from such action,\
companion to such action,\
And its results will be their home.

All actions with intention,\
Be they skilful or harmful &ndash;\
Of such acts they will be the heirs.

### Verses of Sharing and Aspiration<a id="sharing"></a>

> [Now let us chant the verses of sharing and aspiration]

Through the goodness that arises from my practice,\
May my spiritual teachers and guides of great virtue,\
My mother, my father, and my relatives,\
The Sun and the Moon, and all virtuous\
<span class="vin">&nbsp;</span>leaders of the world,\
May the highest gods and evil forces,\
Celestial beings, guardian spirits of the Earth,\
<span class="vin">&nbsp;</span>and the Lord of Death,\
May those who are friendly, indifferent, or hostile,\
May all beings receive the blessings of my life,\
May they soon attain the threefold bliss\
<span class="vin">&nbsp;</span>and realize the Deathless.\
Through the goodness that arises from my practice,\
And through this act of sharing,\
May all desires and attachments quickly cease\
And all harmful states of mind.\
Until I realize Nibbāna,\
In every kind of birth, may I have an upright mind,\
With mindfulness and wisdom, austerity and vigour.\
May the forces of delusion not take hold\
<span class="vin">&nbsp;</span>nor weaken my resolve.\
The Buddha is my excellent refuge,\
Unsurpassed is the protection of the Dhamma,\
The Solitary Buddha is my noble guide,\
The Saṅgha is my supreme support.\
Through the supreme power of all these,\
May darkness and delusion be dispelled.\
[By the power of the ten merits,\
May Māra gain no opening.]
