> Wisely reflecting, I use almsfood: not for fun, not for pleasure, not for

> blamelessly and at ease.'

[Paṭisaṅkhā] yoniso senāsanaṃ paṭisevāmi,\
yāvadeva sītassa paṭighātāya, uṇhassa paṭighātāya,\

uppannānaṃ veyyābādhikānaṃ vedanānaṃ paṭighātāya, abyāpajjha-paramatāyā'ti

> Wisely reflecting, I use supports for the sick and medicinal requisites: only
> to ward off painful feelings that have arisen, for the maximum freedom from
> disease.
