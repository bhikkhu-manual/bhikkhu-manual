## Thai Tradition<a id="thai"></a>

Paritta chanting ceremonies in Thailand vary regionally but may be outlined as:

- a layperson chants the invitation for paritta chanting
- the third bhikkhu or nun in seniority chants the invitation to the devas
- the introductory chants are chanted
- the core sequence of paritta chants follow
- the closing chants end the ceremony.

The third introductory chant in the Mahānikāya sect is commonly *Sambuddhe*.
In Dhammayut circles and frequently in the forest tradition, the third chant is
*Yo cakkhumā* instead.

<!-- NOTE: don't include the Thai script in the ebooks, it crashes certain Kindles -->

There is a shorter and longer traditional core sequence. The *jet tamnaan*
contains D1-D7 as below, the *sipsong tamnaan*
contains S1-S12. Chants that are not numbered 'D' or 'S' can
be included or not, as wished, but should be recited in the order listed here.

### Notes for Particular Chants<a id="particular"></a>

**Asevanā ca bālānaṃ:** The candles on the shrine during a house invitation are
lit by the senior bhikkhu or nun at *Asevanā*.

**Yaṅkiñci vittaṃ:** The candles are put out at *Nibbanti dhīrā yathā'yam
padīpo*.

**Atthi loke sīla-guṇo:** On the occasion of blessing a new house, this chant
should be included, as it is traditionally considered protection against fire.

**Yato'haṃ bhagini:** This chant is to be used for expectant mothers since the
time of the Buddha for the blessing and protection of the mother and child. It
is also a good occasion to chant it when receiving alms from a newly married
couple. Sangha members are encouraged to practise it.

**Dukkhappattā ca niddukkhā:** This is usually chanted as second to last before
*Bhavatu sabba-maṅgalaṃ*. It is considered necessary to include it whenever the
devas have been invited at the beginning of the paritta chanting as this chant
contains a line inviting them to leave again.

**Bāhuṃ sahassam-abhinimmita:** This is is a popular later addition to the
present day standard chants. It is not listed in the *jet tamnaan* or *sipsong
tamnaan* sets. Yet these days it is frequently added just before *Mahā-kāruṇiko
nātho*. On some occasions (e.g. public birthdays, jubilees, inauguration
ceremonies, etc.), it is an alternative, instead of chanting *jet tamnaan* or
*sipsong tamnaan*, to do a minimum sequence called *suat phorn phra* which
contains only:

(1) *Namo Tassa*,\
(2) *Iti pi so bhagavā*,\
(3) *Bāhuṃ*,\
(4) *Mahā-kāruṇiko nātho*, and\
(5) *Bhavatu sabba-maṅgalaṃ*.

In this minimal chanting sequence usually one does not invite the devas.

**Te attha-laddhā sukhitā:** This is sometimes inserted before closing with
*Bhavatu sabba-maṅgalaṃ*, as a special well-wishing when the occasion has to do
with Buddhism in general (e.g. inauguration of a new abbot, or at the end of an
*upasampadā*).

### Invitation to the Devas<a id="devas"></a>

In Thai custom, the third monk in seniority invites the devas, holding his hands
in *añjali*, and lifting up the ceremonial string.

The string is wound up at the beginning of the last chant, *Mahā-kāruṇiko nātho*
or *Bhavatu sabba-maṅgalaṃ*, which should be kept in mind by the last bhikkhu or
*sāmaṇera*.

Before royal ceremonies, the invitation starts with A.

Before the shorter *jet tamnaan* set of parittas, B is used and C is omitted.
Before the longer *sipsong tamnaan* set of parittas, B is omitted and C is used.

The verses at D are always chanted.

When chanting outside the monastery, the invitation is concluded with E. When
chanting at the monastery, the invitation is concluded with either E or F.

the Protector and Mentor for the world.\
By the majesty of this, may you have triumph and success,\
and may all your dangers be destroyed.

The Teacher's Dhamma, like a banner,\
shows the path of purity to the world.\
Leading out, upholding those who uphold it,\
rightly accomplished, it brings pleasure, makes peace.

I pay homage with my head to that excellent Dhamma,\
which pierces delusion and makes fever grow calm.\
By the majesty of this, may you have triumph and success,\
and may all your dangers be destroyed.

The True Dhamma's army, following the One Well-Gone,\
is victor over the evils and corruptions of the world.\
Self-calmed, it is calming and unfettering,\
and makes the well-taught Dhamma be known.

I pay homage with my head to that excellent Saṅgha,\
awakened following the Awakened One, harmonious in virtue and view.\
By the majesty of this, may you have triumph and success,\
and may all your dangers be destroyed.

#### The Thirty-Eight Highest Blessings<a id="thirty-eight"></a>

> [Now let us chant the verses on the Highest Blessings]

[Thus have I heard that the Blessed One]\
Was staying at Sāvatthī,\
Residing at the Jeta's Grove\
In Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.

Then in the dark of the night, a radiant deva\
Illuminated all Jeta's Grove.\
She bowed down low before the Blessed One\
Then standing to one side she said:

'Devas are concerned for happiness\
And ever long for peace.\
The same is true for humankind.\
What then are the highest blessings?'

Avoiding those of foolish ways,\
Associating with the wise,\
And honouring those worthy of honour.\
These are the highest blessings.

Living in places of suitable kinds,\
With the fruits of past good deeds\
And guided by the rightful way.\
These are the highest blessings.

Accomplished in learning and craftsman's skills,\
With discipline, highly trained,\
And speech that is true and pleasant to hear.\
These are the highest blessings.

Providing for mother and father's support\
And cherishing family,\
And ways of work that harm no being,\
These are the highest blessings.

Generosity and a righteous life,\
Offering help to relatives and kin,\
And acting in ways that leave no blame.\
These are the highest blessings.

Steadfast in restraint, and shunning evil ways,\
Avoiding intoxicants that dull the mind,\
And heedfulness in all things that arise.\
These are the highest blessings.

Respectfulness and being of humble ways,\
Contentment and gratitude,\
And hearing the Dhamma frequently taught.\
These are the highest blessings.

Patience and willingness to accept one's faults,\
Seeing venerated seekers of the truth,\
And sharing often the words of Dhamma.\
These are the highest blessings.

Ardent, committed to the Holy Life,\
Seeing for oneself the Noble Truths\
And the realization of Nibbāna.\
These are the highest blessings.

Although in contact with the world,\
Unshaken the mind remains\
Beyond all sorrow, spotless, secure.\
These are the highest blessings.

They who live by following this path\
Know victory wherever they go,\
And every place for them is safe.\
These are the highest blessings.

#### Verses from the Discourse on Treasures<a id="treasures"></a>

<div class="instr">

> (The translations correspond to the numbered verses above.)

</div>

**1.**\
Whatever wealth in this world or the next,\
whatever exquisite treasure in the heavens,\
is not, for us, equal to the Tathāgata.\
This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Buddha.\
By this truth may there be well-being.

**2.**\
The exquisite Deathless &ndash; dispassion, ending &ndash;\
discovered by the Sakyan Sage while in concentration:\
There is nothing equal to that Dhamma.\
This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Dhamma.\
By this truth may there be well-being.

**3.**\
What the excellent Awakened One extolled as pure\
and called the concentration of unmediated knowing:\
No equal to that concentration can be found.\
This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Dhamma.\
By this truth may there be well-being.

**4.**\
The eight persons &ndash; the four pairs &ndash;\
praised by those at peace:\
They, disciples of the One Well-Gone, deserve offerings.\
What is given to them bears great fruit.\
This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saṅgha.\
By this truth may there be well-being.

**5.**\
Those who, devoted, firm-minded,\
apply themselves to Gotama's message,\
on attaining their goal, plunge into the Deathless,\
freely enjoying the Unbinding they've gained.\
This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saṅgha.\
By this truth may there be well-being.

**6.**\
Ended the old, there is no new taking birth.\
Dispassioned their minds toward further becoming,\
they &ndash; with no seed, no desire for growth,\
enlightened &ndash; go out like this flame.\
This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saṅgha.\
By this truth may there be well-being.

#### The Buddha's Words on Loving-Kindness<a id="loving-kindness"></a>

> [Now let us chant the Buddha's words on loving-kindness]

[This is what should be done]\
By one who is skilled in goodness\
And who knows the path of peace:\
Let them be able and upright,\
Straightforward and gentle in speech,

Humble and not conceited,\
Contented and easily satisfied,\
Unburdened with duties and frugal in their ways.\
Peaceful and calm, and wise and skilful,\
Not proud and demanding in nature.

Let them not do the slightest thing\
That the wise would later reprove,\
Wishing: In gladness and in safety,\
May all beings be at ease.

Whatever living beings there may be,\
Whether they are weak or strong, omitting none,\
The great or the mighty, medium, short, or small,

The seen and the unseen,\
Those living near and far away,\
Those born and to be born,\
May all beings be at ease.

Let none deceive another\
Or despise any being in any state.\
Let none through anger or ill-will\
Wish harm upon another.

Even as a mother protects with her life\
Her child, her only child,\
So with a boundless heart\
Should one cherish all living beings,\
Radiating kindness over the entire world:

Spreading upwards to the skies\
And downwards to the depths,\
Outwards and unbounded,\
Freed from hatred and ill-will.

Whether standing or walking, seated, \
Or lying down &ndash; free from drowsiness &ndash;\
One should sustain this recollection.\
This is said to be the sublime abiding.

By not holding to fixed views,\
The pure-hearted one, having clarity of vision,\
Being freed from all sense-desires,\
Is not born again into this world.

#### The Group Protection<a id="group-protection"></a>

I have goodwill for the Virupakkhas, the Erapathas,\
goodwill for the Chabya descendants, and the Black Gotamakas.

I have goodwill for footless beings, two-footed beings,\
goodwill for four-footed, and many-footed beings.

May footless beings, two-footed beings do me no harm.\
May four-footed beings and many-footed beings do me no harm.

May all creatures, all breathing things, all beings &ndash; each and every one &ndash;\
meet with good fortune. May none of them come to any evil.

Limitless is the Buddha, limitless the Dhamma, limitless the Saṅgha.

There is a limit to creeping things &ndash; snakes, scorpions, centipedes, spiders,
lizards and rats.

I have made this protection, I have made this spell.\
May the beings depart.\
I pay homage to the Blessed One,\
homage to the seven Rightly Self-awakened Ones.

#### The Quail's Protection<a id="quail"></a>

There is in this world the quality of virtue,\
truth, purity, tenderness.\
In accordance with this truth I will make\
an unsurpassed vow of truth.

Sensing the strength of the Dhamma,\
calling to mind the victors of the past,\
in dependence on the strength of truth,\
I made an unsurpassed vow of truth:

Here are wings with no feathers;\
here are feet that can't walk.\
My mother and father have left me.\
Fire, go back!

When I made my vow with truth,\
the great crested flames\
avoided the sixteen acres around me\
as if they had come to a body of water.\
My truth has no equal:\
Such is my perfection of truth.

#### The Factors of Awakening Protection<a id="awakening"></a>

The factors for Awakening include: mindfulness, analysis of qualities,
persistence, rapture, and calm as factors for Awakening, plus concentration and
equanimity.

These seven, which the All-seeing Sage has rightly taught, when developed and
matured, bring about heightened knowledge, Unbinding and Awakening.

By the utterance of this truth, may you always be well.

At one time, our Protector &ndash; seeing that Moggallāna and Kassapa were sick and
in pain &ndash; taught them the seven factors for Awakening.

They, delighting in that, were instantly freed from their illness.

By the utterance of this truth, may you always be well.

Once, when the Dhamma King was afflicted with fever, he had the Elder Cunda
recite that very teaching with devotion. And as he approved, he rose up from
that disease.

By the utterance of this truth, may you always be well.

Those diseases were abandoned by the three great seers, just as defilements are
demolished by the Path in accordance with step-by-step attainment.

By the utterance of this truth, may you always be well.

May all beings: who have fallen into suffering be without suffering,\
who have fallen into danger be without danger,\
who have fallen into sorrow be without sorrow.

For the sake of all attainment and success, may all heavenly beings\
rejoice in the extent to which we have gathered a consummation of merit.

May they give gifts with conviction, may they always maintain virtue.\
May they delight in meditation. May they go to a heavenly destination.

From the strength attained by all the Buddhas,\
the strength of the Private Buddhas,\
by the majesty of the arahants,\
I bind this protection all around.

#### Verses on the Buddha's Victories<a id="victories"></a>

Creating a form with a thousand arms, each equipped with a weapon,\
Māra, on the elephant Girimekhala,\
uttered a frightening roar together with his troops.\
The Lord of Sages defeated him by means of such qualities as generosity:\
By the majesty of this, may you have blessings of victory.

Even more frightful than Māra making war all night,\
was Āḷavaka, the arrogant unstable ogre.\
The Lord of Sages defeated him by means of well-trained endurance:\
By the majesty of this, may you have blessings of victory.

Nāḷāgiri, the excellent elephant, when maddened,\
was very horrific, like a forest fire, a flaming discus, a lightning bolt.\
The Lord of Sages defeated him by sprinkling the water of goodwill:\
By the majesty of this, may you have blessings of victory.

Very horrific, with a sword upraised in his expert hand,\
Garlanded-with-Fingers ran three leages along the path.\
The Lord of Sages defeated him with mind-fashioned marvels:\
By the majesty of this, may you have blessings of victory.

Having made a wooden belly to appear pregnant,\
Ciñcā made a lewd accusation in the midst of the gathering.\
The Lord of Sages defeated her with peaceful, gracious means:\
By the majesty of this, may you have blessings of victory.

Saccaka, whose provocative views had abandoned the truth,\
his mind delighting in argument, had become thoroughly blind.\
The Lord of Sages defeated him with the light of discernment:\
By the majesty of this, may you have blessings of victory.

Nandopananda was a serpent with great power but wrong views.\
The Lord of Sages defeated him by means of a display of marvels,\
sending his son (Moggallāna), the serpent-elder, to tame him:\
By the majesty of this, may you have blessings of victory.

His hands bound tight by the serpent of wrongly held views,\
Baka, the Brahmā, thought himself pure in his radiance and power.\
The Lord of Sages defeated him by means of his words of knowledge:
By the majesty of this, may you have blessings of victory.

These eight verses of the Buddha's blessings of victory:\
Whatever person of discernment\
recites or recalls them day after day without lapsing,\
destroying all kinds of obstacles,\
will attain liberation and happiness.

#### Victory Protection<a id="victory-protection"></a>

(The Buddha), our protector, with great compassion,\
for the welfare of all beings,\
having fulfilled all the perfections,\
attained the highest self-awakening.\
By the utterance of this truth,\
may you have a blessing of victory.

Victorious at the foot of the Bodhi tree,\
was he who increased the Sakyans' delight.\
May you have the same sort of victory.\
May you win blessings of victory.

At the head of the lotus leaf of the world\
on the undefeated seat\
consecrated by all the Buddhas,\
he rejoiced in the utmost attainment.

A lucky star it is, a lucky blessing,\
a lucky dawn, a lucky sacrifice,\
a lucky instant, a lucky moment,\
a lucky offering: i.e., a rightful bodily act\
a rightful verbal act, a rightful mental act,\
your rightful intentions\
with regard to those who lead the holy life.\
Doing these rightful things,
your rightful aims are achieved.

### The Twenty-Eight Buddhas' Protection<a id="twenty-eight"></a>

<div class="instr">

> We will now recite the discourse given by the Great Hero\
> (the Buddha), as a protection for virtue-loving human beings,\
> Against harm from all evil-doing, malevolent non-humans who are\
> displeased with the Buddha's Teachings.

Homage to all Buddhas, the mighty who have arisen:\
Taṇhaṅkara, the great hero, Medhaṅkara, the renowned,\
Saraṇaṅkara, who guarded the world, Dīpaṅkara, the light-bearer,\
Koṇḍañña, liberator of people, Maṅgala, great leader of people,\
Sumana, kindly and wise, Revata, increaser of joy,\
Sobhita, perfected in virtues, Anomadassī, greatest of beings,\
Paduma, illuminer of the world, Nārada, true charioteer,\
Padumuttara, most excellent of beings, Sumedha, the unequalled one,\
Sujāta, summit of the world,  Piyadassī, great leader of men,\
Atthadassī, the compassionate, Dhammadassī, destroyer of darkness,\
Siddhattha, unequalled in the world,  and Tissa, speaker of Truth,\
Phussa, bestower of blessings, Vipassī, the incomparable,\
Sikhī, the bliss-bestowing teacher, Vessabhū, giver of happiness,\
Kakusandha, the caravan leader, Koṇāgamana, abandoner of ills,\
Kassapa, perfect in glory, Gotama, chief of the Sakyans.

These and all self-enlightened Buddhas are also peerless ones,\
All the Buddhas together, all of mighty power,\
All endowed with the Ten Powers, attained to highest knowledge,\
All of these are accorded the supreme place of leadership.\
They roar the lion's roar with confidence among their followers,\
They observe with the divine eye, unhindered, all the world.\
The leaders endowed with the eighteen kinds of Buddha-Dhamma,\
The thirty-two major and eighty minor marks of a great being,\
Shining with fathom-wide haloes, all these elephant-like sages,\
All these omniscient Buddhas, conquerors free of corruption,\
Of mighty brilliance, mighty power, of mighty wisdom, mighty strength,\
Of mighty compassion and wisdom, bearing bliss to all,\
Islands, guardians and supports, shelters and caves for all beings,\
Resorts, kinsmen and comforters, benevolent givers of refuge,\
These are all the final resting place for the world with its deities.\
With my head at their feet I salute these greatest of humans.\
With both speech and thought I venerate those Tathāgatas,\
Whether lying down, seated or standing, or walking anywhere.\
May they ever guard your happiness, the Buddhas, bringers of peace,\
And may you, guarded by them, at peace, freed from all fear,\
Released from all illness, safe from all torments,\
Having transcended hatred, may you gain cessation.

By the power of their truth, their virtue and love,\
May they protect and guard you in health and happiness.\
In the Eastern quarter are beings of great power,\
May they protect and guard you in health and happiness.\
In the Southern quarter are deities of great power,\
May they protect and guard you in health and happiness.\
In the Western quarter are dragons of great power,\
May they protect and guard you in health and happiness.\
In the Northern quarter are spirits of great power,\
May they protect and guard you in health and happiness.\
In the East is Dhataraṭṭha, in the South is Viruḷhaka,\
In the West is Virūpakkha, Kuvera rules the North.\
These Four Mighty Kings, far-famed guardians of the world,\
May they all be your protectors in health and happiness.\
Sky-dwelling and earth-dwelling gods and dragons of great power,\
May they all be your protectors in health and happiness.\
For me there is no other refuge, the Buddha is my excellent refuge:\
By this declaration of truth may the blessings of victory be yours.\
For me there is no other refuge, the Dhamma is my excellent refuge:\
By this declaration of truth may the blessings of victory be yours.\
For me there is no other refuge, the Saṅgha is my excellent refuge:\
By this declaration of truth may the blessings of victory be yours.

Whatever jewel may be found in the world, however splendid,\
There is no jewel equal to the Buddha, therefore may you be blessed.\
Whatever jewel may be found in the world, however splendid,\
There is no jewel equal to the Dhamma, therefore may you be blessed.\
Whatever jewel may be found in the world, however splendid,\
There is no jewel equal to the Saṅgha, therefore may you be blessed.\
If you venerate the Buddha jewel, the supreme, excellent protection,\
Which benefits gods and humans, then in safety, by the Buddha's power,\
All dangers will be prevented, your sorrows will pass away.\
If you venerate the Dhamma jewel, the supreme, excellent protection,\
Which calms all fevered states, then in safety, by the Dhamma's power,\
All dangers will be prevented, your fears will pass away.\
If you venerate the Saṅgha jewel, the supreme, excellent protection,\
Worthy of gifts and hospitality, then in safety, by the Saṅgha's power,\
All dangers will be prevented, your sicknesses will pass away.\
May all calamities be avoided, may all illness pass away,\
May no dangers threaten you, may you be happy and long-lived,\
Greeted kindly and welcome everywhere.\
May four things accrue to you: long life, beauty, bliss, and strength.

#### Verses on the Three Characteristics<a id="three-characteristics"></a>

'Impermanent are all conditioned things' &ndash;\
When with wisdom this is seen\
One feels weary of all dukkha;\
This is the path to purity.

'Dukkha are all conditioned things' &ndash;\
When with wisdom this is seen\
One feels weary of all dukkha;\
This is the path to purity.

'There is no self in anything' &ndash;\
When with wisdom this is seen\
One feels weary of all dukkha;\
This is the path to purity.

Few amongst humankind\
Are those who go beyond,\
Yet there are the many folks\
Ever wand'ring on this shore.

Wherever Dhamma is well-taught,\
Those who train in line with it\
Are the ones who will cross over\
The realm of death so hard to flee.

Abandoning the darker states,\
The wise pursue the bright;\
From the floods dry land they reach\
Living withdrawn so hard to do.\
Such rare delight one should desire,\
Sense pleasures cast away,\
Not having anything.
