## Dedication of Offerings (English)<a id="dedication-english"></a>

[To the Blessed One,] the Lord, who fully attained\
perfect enlightenment,\
To the Teaching, which he expounded so well,\
And to the Blessed One's disciples who have practised well,\
To these &ndash; the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha &ndash;\
We render with offerings our rightful homage.\

Still had compassion for later generations.\
May these simple offerings be accepted\
For our long-lasting benefit and for the happiness it gives us.\
The Lord, the Perfectly Enlightened and Blessed One &ndash;\
I render homage to the Buddha, the Blessed One.
