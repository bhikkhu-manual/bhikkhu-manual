## Dedication of Offerings (English)

[To the Blessed One,] the Lord, who fully attained\
perfect enlightenment,\
To the Teaching, which he expounded so well,\
And to the Blessed One's disciples who have practised well,\
To these --- the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha ---\
We render with offerings our rightful homage.\
It is well for us that the Blessed One, having attained liberation,\
Still had compassion for later generations.\
May these simple offerings be accepted\
For our long-lasting benefit and for the happiness it gives us.\
The Lord, the Perfectly Enlightened and Blessed One ---\
I render homage to the Buddha, the Blessed One.

[The Teaching,] so completely explained by him ---\
I bow to the Dhamma.

[The Blessed One's disciples,] who have practised well ---\
I bow to the Saṅgha.
